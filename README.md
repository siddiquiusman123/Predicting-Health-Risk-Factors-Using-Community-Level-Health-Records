# 🏥 Predicting Health Risk Factors Using Community-Level Health Records

This project predicts the **overall community health status** as **Bad, Fair, or Good** using machine learning models.  
By analyzing **community-level health records**, the system provides insights into the general well-being of a population and identifies areas that require attention.  

It is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**, where users can input health-related data and get instant predictions.

## 📌 Features
- Classifies health status into **Bad / Fair / Good** categories  
- Uses **community-level health datasets** for training  
- Preprocessing & feature engineering for improved predictions  
- Multiple ML models tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Interactive **Streamlit UI** for real-time prediction and visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Joblib

## 📊 Results
- Achieved strong accuracy with **Random Forest / XGBoost**  
- Predictions are based on community health indicators such as:  
  - Age
  - Gender 
  - BMI
  - Blood Pressure
  - Smoker or not
  - Diabetes
  - Height
  - Cholestrol
    

**Output Classes:**  
- 🟥 **Bad** → High risk, poor community health indicators  
- 🟨 **Fair** → Moderate risk, average health indicators  
- 🟩 **Good** → Low risk, healthy community profile
